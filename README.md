# Overview

I created this text-based RPG game in Java. I wanted to learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming in Java while doing something that I thought would be fun.
This content was cool to create the story for a while using multiple classes and superclasses to create this system.

# Development Environment

I used the free version of IntelliJ Idea Community Version. I used Java to write this code and I imported the math library
for the calculations with the battles

# Future Work

- I need to create the enemies and calculate their damages
- I need to create the shop 
- I need to finish working on the game loop to help it function better
